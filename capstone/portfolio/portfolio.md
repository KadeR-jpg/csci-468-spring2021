# Section Two: Teamwork
For this course i was the main contributor for this project.This includes the code for 
tokenization, evaluation and byte-code. My partner {team-member 2} was responsible for 
providing documentation and 3 tests for my code base. This includes providing well structured
and concise documentation for my code. Also my partner {team-member 2} will write 3 tests for
my code that could written for tokenization, evaluation and/or byte-code. These test will be expected 
to be unique and run able with my current code. Team member contributions were 50/50 as we both
provided the same things to each other i would
assume that we spent about two to four hours on each others
projects.
